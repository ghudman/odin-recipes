    <h2>Great easy to cook meal for four!</h2>
    <p>This hearty Irish lamb shank stew is perfect if you feel like having something a little different on St. Patrick's Day.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 lamb shanks</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle stout (such as GuinnessÂ®) or porter</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat until oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot oil on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove lamb shanks and set aside. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and tomato paste; cook for 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Return lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer. Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. Stir in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig and herb bundle before serving.</li>
    </ol>
